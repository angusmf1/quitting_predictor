    "## Notebooks Overview\n",
    "This section provides an overview of the key tasks and analyses carried out in the additional notebooks of the 'Quitting Predictor' project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Invalid or illogical data entries were systematically removed to ensure the dataset's quality and reliability.\n",
    "Instances with false experience (exp_check == 1), negative experience in job_duration columns, and total experience exceeding 900 months were excluded.\n",
    "Records associated with job titles like 'intern', 'student', 'owner', etc., were filtered out to focus on meaningful job roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance Threshold for Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance thresholding was employed to select features with high variance, thereby identifying relevant features that contribute significantly to the model's predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Categorization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-numeric features like 'job_level' and 'linkedin_connections' were transformed into numeric categories, facilitating their integration into machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorization of Job Titles:\n",
    "\n",
    "Employed fuzzy matching techniques to categorize job titles into six major categories: 'Software Development', 'Business Intelligence', 'Cyber Security', 'Cloud/DevOps', 'Data Science/Machine Learning', and 'Other'.\n",
    "Entries classified as 'Other' were excluded to ensure consistency and relevance in subsequent analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented PCA on the top 1000 companies to minimize the number of columns while retaining maximum variance.\n",
    "This dimensionality reduction technique optimizes feature space for efficient modeling and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Balancing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilized the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the minority class to 50% of the majority class.\n",
    "This approach enhances model performance by mitigating class imbalance effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conducted hyperparameter tuning for the XGBoost algorithm to optimize model performance.\n",
    "Systematically searched for the best combination of hyperparameters using cross-validation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### XGBoost Model Training:\n",
    "\n",
    "Trained an XGBoost model with the identified optimal parameters.\n",
    "Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as ROC curve and classification report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cox Survival Regression:\n",
    "Implemented the Cox survival regression model to identify candidates with a higher probability of quitting within the next 6 months.\n",
    "This technique captures the time-to-event relationship and provides insights into candidates at higher risk of leaving."
