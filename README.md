# quitting_predictor

Trains a ML model to predict Quitters and NonQuitters

### 1. download the dataset 

**Download 'quitting_Data_Aug3.csv' from the dataset link and save in the same directory as the other code**

### 2. Qutting Predictor Classifier v2

**This code should be able to run after ensure all modules are installed/imported** 

**The CatBoost model is the primary classifier used. After importing the data and running some simple prepossing, run the fit_classifaction function to tune the classifer to find the best hyperparameters. Next, take those hyperparameters and create a new CatBoost Model with increased number of iterations and run the test_model function to test model performance.** 

**Next work to be done: Check for model overfitting and try to reduce complexity by reducing the number of features to only the most relevant featurres.** 

### 3. Normalizing datasets

**This repository contains many .py scripts used for cleaning/normalizing future datasets**
